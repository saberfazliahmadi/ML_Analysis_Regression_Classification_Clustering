## Comprehensive Machine Learning Analysis

This repository showcases a detailed machine learning workflow applied to a dataset. The workflow includes:  
- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, etc.  
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.  
- **Clustering Techniques**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.

## Key Features
- Comparison of accuracy metrics across models.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Selection of the best-performing model.
- Application of clustering based on user-selected features.
