# ML_Analysis_Regression_Classification_Clustering
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning analysis on a dataset, comparing the accuracy of various regression and classification models, selecting the best model, and applying clustering techniques. It demonstrates my expertise in Python, machine learning, and data analysis.

# Comprehensive Machine Learning Analysis

This repository showcases a detailed machine learning workflow applied to a dataset. It involves:  
- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, etc.  
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.  
- **Clustering**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.

## Key Features
- Comparison of accuracy metrics across models.
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Identification of the best-performing model.
- Application of clustering based on user-selected features.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saberfazliahmadi/ML_Analysis_Regression_Classification_Clustering.git
